                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The bassoon is a woodwind instrument in the double reed family, which plays in the tenor and bass ranges. It is composed of six pieces and is usually made of wood. It is known for its distinctive tone color, wide range, versatility, and virtuosity. It is a non-transposing instrument and typically its music is written in the bass and tenor clefs, and sometimes in the treble. There are two forms of modern bassoon: the Buffet (or French) and Heckel (or German) systems.</p>

                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                <p>Ludwig Van Beethoven once said: “Never break the silence if it is not to improve it.” Our main purpose goes beyond selling and profiting ourselves with classes and items for sale. Our ultimate purpose is to make a better world, beautified by music. We know everyone deserves to be happy. One of the many ways we accomplish that is by doing what we like. Some people love playing music, others love listening to it. In any case that makes this world a better place. That's what we do, we are helping build a better world.</p>
