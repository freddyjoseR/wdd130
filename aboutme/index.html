    <h2>Fred</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Freddy Rodriguez, you can call me Freddy. I am from Venezuela. Some of the things I really love doing are playing music both bassoon and piano, watching movies and series, listening to music and singing, playing sports, basketball especially, sharing with friends, to know new people and places, I really love to travel. Currently, I don't have a major. I am not married yet. My parents are from here Venezuela. This will be my first High Education Degree. I think that the knowledge this course offers is so useful because it is all about the things I expect to do when I am working, and it will help me to develop my family's projects and websites.</p>
    <p>I was baptized in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints when I was nine years old. Now it was around 12 years ago when I first joined the Church. One of my favorite quotes from the Church's leaders is "One day when you know who you really are, you will regret to have been wasting your time". It's something President Henry B. Eyring shared. One of my favorite scriptures is in The Doctrine and Covenants 101:16 it says: "Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God". This Scripture reminds me that I have to trust in God and all things will be made right for me.</p>
